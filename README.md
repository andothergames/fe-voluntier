This is the front-end repo for Voluntier, a mobile app that connects volunteers with charitable organisations in need of help. Volunteers can sign up and search/favourite/apply for opportunities. Organisations can sign up, post listings and award badges to volunteers for their donated hours.

The app was developed by [Northcoders Students](https://northcoders.com/) in an eight-day project as part of the [Software Development Bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/skills-bootcamp-in-software-development).

Developers who worked on the project: [Tomasz](https://github.com/TomaszSarmata), [Lia](https://github.com/LiaPickles), [Tom](https://github.com/tomfollows), [Joseph](https://github.com/Joseph-Lee98), [Matt](https://github.com/CoderMattGH), [Joy](https://github.com/andothergames)

I worked on wireframes, UI design, branding, app navigation, conditional rendering depending on user type, log in/sign up forms and the logic for organisations awarding badges.
